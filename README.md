# Mathbot
A Discord bot that does simple math.

Mathbot requires you to host your own instance, since I currently don't have the money to host it on a webserver 24/7.

## Requirements
* node.js (v6.11.2 or later recommended)

## Installation
1. Create a new app on [https://discordapp.com/developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and create a bot user for it.

2. Install `discord.js` by typing `npm install discord.js` in the command line.

3. Download this GitHub repository.

4. Fill in your bot's Client ID and Bot Token in `config.json`.

5. Navigate to the bot folder in the command line and run the bot with `node bot.js`.

6. Once your bot is up and running, it will spit out a hyperlink in the console. You can use this link to add the bot to servers.

## Usage
To launch Mathbot again after you have closed the command line, simply navigate to your Mathbot folder and enter `node bot.js`.

If you need help with the commands, type `math.help` in the chat of a server that Mathbot is a member of.

If that didn't quite solve your problem, join [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/n27yKQN) and ask away!
